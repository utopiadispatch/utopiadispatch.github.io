<p>Ever get the feeling that the world could be a little bit better? Fed up with war, poverty, inequality, climate doom, and more? So are we.</p>

<p>Utopia Dispatch is your antidote, taking on the small task of radically reimagining the future of human society, while somehow managing to keep our spirits up at the same time.</p>

<p>We talk to thinkers with ideas that break the mould, and to citizens taking radical action for a better future, to bring you closer to a vision of the future we actually all want, and we might even have a few laughs along the way.</p>

<p>The show is produced and co-hosted by <a href = "https://twitter.com/smgholliday">Sarah Holliday</a>, <a href = "https://twitter.com/chemicalolive">Ollie Levers</a> and <a href = "https://twitter.com/g_r_richardson">George Richardson</a>.</p>
