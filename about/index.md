Ever get the feeling that the world could be a little bit better? Fed up with war, poverty, inequality, climate doom, and more? So are we. 

Utopia Dispatch is your antidote, taking on the small task of radically reimagining the future of human society, while somehow managing to keep our spirits up at the same time.

We talk to thinkers with ideas that break the mould, and to citizens taking radical action for a better future, to bring you closer to a vision of the future we actually all want, and we might even have a few laughs along the way.

The show is co-hosted by [Sarah Holliday](https://twitter.com/smgholliday), [Ollie Levers](https://twitter.com/chemicalolive), and [George Richardson](http://georgerichardson.net).
