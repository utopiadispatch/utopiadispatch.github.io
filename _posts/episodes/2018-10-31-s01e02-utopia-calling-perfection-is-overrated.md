In Episode 1, we heard about the need to start putting forward a new vision of the society that we want. Here, the team tries to understand how the idea of Utopia can be used as a tool for transforming the way we think about the world and to enable change. We explore some of the ins and a few of the outs, and start to see that unleashing our collective imaginations might just be what we need to wreak joy throughout the universe.

Utopia Dispatch is the podcast talking to people with thinking big ideas and taking radical action, to figure out what a better world might look like. Follow us as we embark on our journey into humanity's possible brighter futures.
