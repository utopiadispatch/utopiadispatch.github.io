In the second episode of Utopia Dispatch we look at our first potentially world-changing idea - [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income). It has been hailed as a possible means to reduce poverty, inequality, and increase freedom, but is it as utopian as it seems? We make an attempt to grasp both the mind-bogglingly far-reaching positive and negative impacts for a society with universal basic income.
