Last year we launched Utopia Dispatch as a bit of an experiment. Since the last episode, people keep asking us when there's going to be more. We enjoyed making it, but life got in the way for a while, and we also knew we could make something bigger and better if we put in the effort. After reflecting on what worked, and what didn't, we're coming back. There's going to be a new format, with more in-depth episodes, but we'll make sure to have a few laughs along the way. Works are under way to craft the new podcast and we think it's going to be pretty special. Old episodes will go into the archive (but will remain available). It will take a bit of time to get this off the ground, but it's going to be worth it. See you on the other side.
